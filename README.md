# LocalBridge-AI
LocalBridge AI is an AI-driven decision support system designed to simplify franchise investment and expansion planning. The platform connects investors and franchise owners through a dual-dashboard architecture, enabling location-based franchise discovery and data-driven decision making.

The system matches user-selected locations and budgets with available franchises, identifies city-restricted or all-location opportunities, and applies machine learning regression for ROI prediction, time-series analysis for seasonal profit–loss forecasting, and classification models for franchise–location compatibility scoring. By combining location intelligence with predictive analytics, LocalBridge AI helps investors make informed, low-risk franchise investment decisions.
